The above rep counts would be for an elite athlete looking to have more than the requisite power to navigate our courses. The Spartan 1500, as written above, is a muscular endurance super-charger. It’s not impossible to do the above workout in 1 hour, but you’ll have to go through hell to do it.

You can divide all the rep counts by 10 and still have an effective strength training workout. Always scale a workout based upon your current level. Maintaining proper form is far superior than pushing out a few sloppy last reps.
