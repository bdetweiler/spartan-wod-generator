Fixed to a Star

He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind. Leonardo da Vinci

Set your goal on the horizon and run until you get there. To do a Spartan Race you should be able to run/jog/walk/crawl for 3 hours. Yes, 180 minutes. Today, lock your mind on that goal and let nothing stop you from reaching it.
