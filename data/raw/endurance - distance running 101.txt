Distance Running 101

“Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.” – Sam Levenson

Endurance training is always about going digging deeper and going farther. Instead of looking at the clock, look within. That’s where you will find what you are looking for.

Road or trail, just run for two hours. Flat terrain or mountainous, just run for two hours. Learn to pace yourself so that you can finish in style.
