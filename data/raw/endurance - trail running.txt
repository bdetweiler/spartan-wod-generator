Trail Running

The obstacle is the path. – Zen Proverb

Trail run. Welcome all the fallen trees, raging rivers, and boulders that might get your way. Climb. Jump. Crawl, if you have to. Go running where the trails aren’t. That is the path towards race day.

Try to go for 2-3 hours. Bring water, and even a snack.
