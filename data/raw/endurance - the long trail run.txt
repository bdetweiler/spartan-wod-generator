The Long Trail Run

“That which we persist in doing becomes easier, not that the task itself has become easier, but that our ability to perform it has improved.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson

Go for a run – 20 minutes to 3 hours. Do what your body and schedule allows. The more time you spend running, the better your running will be. It takes time. There are no shortcuts. Just enjoy the process.

Don’t forget to stretch!
