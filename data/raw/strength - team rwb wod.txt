Strength: Team RWB WOD

“Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity.” – John F. Kennedy

About 21 Guns — Memorial Day WOD

A 21 Gun Salute is the Nation’s highest display of honor, appropriately reserved for our Fallen troops on Memorial Day. Our WOD intends to replicate this, to honor our Nation’s Warriors, past, present, and future. The 21 minute workout and 21 repetitions signify a 21-gun salute, and the 5 exercises are one for each Branch of the Military.
