# Spartan WOD (Workout of the Day) Generator

As a Spartan Race finisher, I'm a big fan of minimalist workouts, particularly HIIT workouts. 
Spartan.com used to email me a daily WOD and it was a nice way of keeping myself accountable. 
I would not remove the email from my inbox until I had done it. It was a nice easy TODO list.

But then I stopped receiving the emails, and I'm not sure who is at fault there.

Then I heard about a data science project to map cultural cuisines by examining recipes. 

Spartan WODs are essentially recipes. You take "ingredients" (exercises) and measure them (sets/reps/duration), 
and put them together to get a dish (WOD). So I wondered if I could create a probabilistic model and generate new
workouts given old ones.

In addition, Spartan WODs often had elements of things I could never do, like swimming or trail running, because I lack
resources like pools and trails. So I wanted to be able to select my resources or preferences
and get a tailored workout based on that.
